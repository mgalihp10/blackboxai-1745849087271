# WhatsApp Database Service

## Project Overview
The WhatsApp Database Service is a containerized solution that sets up a PostgreSQL database for a WhatsApp-like application. This service uses Docker Compose to simplify the deployment of the database environment, ensuring that all dependencies and configurations are handled automatically.

## Installation
To get started with the WhatsApp Database Service, you'll need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. Here’s how to install them:

1. **Install Docker**: Follow the instructions on [Docker's official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker for your OS.
2. **Install Docker Compose**: Follow the instructions on [Docker Compose's official website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for your OS.

Once you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

## Usage
1. To build and run the PostgreSQL service, navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will spin up the PostgreSQL database service in detached mode. You can access the database on localhost at port `5432` with the following credentials:
- **Username**: `whatsapp_user`
- **Password**: `whatsapp_pass`
- **Database Name**: `whatsapp_db`

3. To stop the service, use:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Features
- **Easy Setup**: Quickly set up a PostgreSQL database with Docker.
- **Persistent Data**: Uses Docker volumes to persist data even when containers are stopped or removed.
- **Customizable Configuration**: Environment variables allow easy customization for database user, password, and database name.

## Dependencies
This project relies on Docker and Docker Compose to create and manage the services. There are no additional dependencies specified in a `package.json` file.
